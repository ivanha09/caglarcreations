        comment: `The wallet is beautiful and the option of customizing is a plus. Oliver was extremely kind to help with an issue I had. I ordered three wallets with three different messages to each of my three sons. I’m so excited for them to open their gifts on Christmas morning...I know they will love them!`

        comment: `Simply beautiful! Better than I expected, to be honest, at first I was worried and hope that it won’t be bulky but in my opinion, it looks way better in person, I hope I could capture that in my own photograph, also let me add that the seller "Oliver" his amazing in communication with his customers and that is why I love to support small businesses who appreciate their customers.`

        comment: `It is better in person, the picture doesn't do justice. I actually bought this a month ago for my 3 year anniversary and my boyfriend loved it! I was nervous at first because this could have been really tacky with the writing, but it is perfect. I got the initials on the front which is really sharp, and than a custom saying in the fold with our date. Like I said I was worried about it being tacky so I emailed Oliver to ask for even more customization to the lettering, he did it no problem just like I wanted. REALLY REALLY QUICKLY!`
